#Use this as the framework below for a base conversation. Add more lines to this list as needed. 
#NOTE: Be mindful to escape apostrophes or quotations that are inside your prompts! So in the example below, "Who's there?" needs to be changed to "Who\'s there?". Eventually I'd like to make this happen automatically, so you don't have to.
